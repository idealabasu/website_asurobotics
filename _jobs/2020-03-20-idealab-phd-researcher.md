## PhD Student Researcher

The IDEAlab at ASU is hiring PhD students in the field of robotics, design, and manufacturing. We are looking for students interested in the following topics:

* Solving tough robotic challenges by applying the lab’s strengths in design, analysis, and manufacturing. 
* Developing new ways to make low-cost robots using non-traditional materials and methods.
* Building new design tools(CAD/CAM) for emerging manufacturing methods and rapid prototyping
<!-- with a focus on STEM education. -->
* Integrating analysis methods more closely with design and manufacturing; for example, adding dynamics, kinematics, simulation, and FEA into design software tailored for specific material systems. 

Interested applicants should hold a Masters(MS) in Engineering or a related field. Applicants must demonstrate a strong theoretical and applied background in 

* Robotics
* Kinematics
* Dynamics
* Manufacturing Theory, 3D printing, and Rapid Prototyping Techniques
* Controls

In terms of required skillsets, applicants should be proficient designers, coders (Python, C, C++),  and makers (rapid prototyping and machining).  Prior work should demonstrate proficiency in electromechanical system design, debugging, and experimental data collection approaches.  Applicants with expertise in the following areas are also desired:

* FEA(nonlinear, hyperelastic, dynamic)
* Machine Learning, AI, and/or Optimization
* Aerodynamics and/or Fluid Simulation
* ROS
* Working with physics engines (MuJoCo, Drake, Unity, Bullet, etc)

If you are interested in these topics, please attach a CV and one-page summary of your research interests to <danaukes@asu.edu>.

## About the Lab

The IDEAlab is part of the Polytechnic School of Engineering, the newest school of engineering at Arizona State University. The Polytechnic Campus in Mesa, AZ is located in a fast-growing part of the Phoenix metropolitan area, with easy access to downtown areas Phoenix and Tempe, while being extraordinarily close to outdoor activities such as hiking and biking. It also features a 15,000 sqf maker space called the Startup Lab and new facilities centered around robotics and manufacturing.

## About ASU

ASU is #1 in the U.S. for innovation U.S. News & World Report ranked ASU No. 1 among the “Most Innovative Schools” in America for 2016, ahead of Stanford at No. 2, MIT at No. 3, as well as Duke, Harvard and Cornell. The top rating was conferred by leading college officials across the country based on ASU’s curriculum, faculty, students, campus life, technology and facilities.
